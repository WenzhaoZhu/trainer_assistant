Given that one of the roots of the cubic polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 + ax + b \) is \( 1 + i \sqrt{3} \), and recognizing that the coefficients of the polynomial are real, the complex conjugate root rule implies that \( 1 - i \sqrt{3} \) is also a root. We denote the third root as \( r \).

Using Vieta's formulas, which state that the sum of the roots (counted with multiplicity) of the polynomial is equal to the opposite of the coefficient of the \( x^2 \) term, divided by the leading coefficient (here the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 0 and the leading coefficient is 1), we get:

\[
(1 + i\sqrt{3}) + (1 - i\sqrt{3}) + r = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2 + r = 0
\]

Thus, the third root \( r \) is:

\[
r = -2
\]

The polynomial can be factored as: 

\[
f(x) = (x - (1 + i\sqrt{3}))(x - (1 - i\sqrt{3}))(x + 2)
\]

To simplify, the product of the conjugates \( (x - (1 + i\sqrt{3}))(x - (1 - i\sqrt{3})) \) is calculated as:

\[
(x - 1 - i\sqrt{3})(x - 1 + i\sqrt{3}) = (x - 1)^2 - (\sqrt{-3})^2 = (x - 1)^2 + 3
\]

Expanding \( (x - 1)^2 \):

\[
(x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
x^2 - 2x + 4
\]

Now, extending it to include the third root:

\[
f(x) = (x^2 - 2x + 4)(x + 2) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x + 2x^2 - 4x + 8 = x^3 + 8
\]

Here, \( a = 0 \) and \( b = 8 \). To verify, we substitute \( 1 + i \sqrt{3} \) into \( f(x) \) and check if it evaluates to zero:

\[
f(1 + i\sqrt{3}) = (1 + i\sqrt{3})^3 + 8
\]

Using the binomial theorem, \( (1 + i\sqrt{3})^3 \) simplifies by simplifying each term:

\[
= 1 + 3(i\sqrt{3}) + 3(-3) + (-i3\sqrt{3})
= 1 + 3i\sqrt{3} - 9 - 3i\sqrt{3} 
= -8
\]

Hence,

\[
f(1 + i\sqrt{3}) = -8 + 8 = 0
\]

This confirms \( 1 + i \sqrt{3} \) is indeed a root, so \( a + b = 0 + 8 = \boxed{8} \).
